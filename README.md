# Loan Verification
This project demonstrates a loan verification and approval system designed to evaluate loan applications based on key financial and employment criteria. The model predicts the likelihood of a customer being approved for a loan and provides immediate feedback on eligibility. Customers can enter their financial credentials, and the system evaluates their application using predefined thresholds. The model predicts the likelihood of a customer being approved for a loan and provides immediate feedback on eligibility. Customers can enter their financial credentials, and the system evaluates their application using predefined thresholds or a machine learning–based approach.
Loan Eligibility Assessment: Evaluates applicants based on credit score, annual income, debt-to-income ratio, down payment, employment status, and years of employment.

Instant Feedback: Provides immediate approval or denial based on customer inputs.

Synthetic Dataset Generation: For testing and model training, the project generates large synthetic datasets simulating realistic loan applications. This dataset includes:

Credit Score

Annual Income

Employment Status

Years of Employment

Down Payment

Requested Loan Amount

Machine Learning–Based Prediction: Utilizes historical data and applicant features to predict the probability of loan approval or deferral.
